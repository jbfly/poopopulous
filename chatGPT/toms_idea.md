Yes, there have been games that incorporate sewage management or water treatment as part of their gameplay. One example is the city-building simulation game, SimCity. In various iterations of SimCity, players are responsible for managing their cities' utilities, including water treatment and sewage management. Players need to build sewage treatment plants, pipelines, and manage their city's infrastructure to prevent pollution and maintain a healthy environment for their citizens.

Another example is Cities: Skylines, another city-building simulation game, where players also have to manage sewage and water treatment systems. Players must build water pumps, sewage treatment plants, and lay pipes to ensure that their city's sewage is handled properly.

While these games don't solely focus on sewage management, they do include it as a part of the overall city management and planning experience. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there isn't a game exclusively focused on sewage management, but it's possible that one has been developed since then or that there may be smaller, indie games that tackle this theme.
