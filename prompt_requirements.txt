There were some issues with the code that was produced by the prompt rewrite the prompt to prevent these:

- The assets need to be imported as modules instead of loaded from the assets folder in the preload function. 
    ex. 
    import poo_sound from './assets/poo.mp3';
    this.load.audio('pooSound', poo_sound);

- We want to use the text poo emjoi ðŸ’© rather than an Image. 
- We want this example to have the poo start from a height above the ground and then fall to the Grid.
- We want one poo to spawn every 400 ms
- the ground should show a grid structue 
-the ground should have some height veriation
